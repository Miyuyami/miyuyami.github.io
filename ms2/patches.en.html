		<h4 class="card-header">Korean MapleStory 2 Patches</h4>
		<div class="card-body">
			<p class="card-text">Same as the Chinese patches but for Korea...</p>
			<p class="card-text">You can use a simple "Game Starter" that I made to help with starting the game without having to go through patching (you still need to patch when a new patch is out!!!)</p>
			<p class="card-text">This helps so that the nexon launcher won't start and replace the patched files. <a href="https://github.com/Miyuyami/NexonGameStarter/releases">You can find it on my github by clicking here.</a></p>
			<p class="card-text">It's very easy to setup, make a shortcut of the GameStarter.exe then right click the shortcut and select Properties. Then under "Target" add at the end " 106498" (without quotes and note the space before the number).</p>
			<p class="card-text">So if the target is <code>"C:\My Games\GameStarter.exe"</code> you must edit it to <code>"C:\My Games\GameStarter.exe" 106498</code>. All you have to do now is run it from the shortcut.</p>
			<p class="card-text">As for how to use... open it and select the "Launch" option to start the game and skipping the file checking, if an error shows up or you know that there's been an update then choose the "Patch" option (make sure you put the backup "Xml" files so that they won't get redownloaded). Now wait until a new patch is available here (check "Last Update") then replace the files, now in the "game stater" choose launch again.</p>

			<p class="card-text">To use different voice files by just copying the sound files off another region. You do not copy all the sound files because you do NOT want to overwrite anything, you just copy the files that contain "kor" or "cn" in their file names, depending on the respective region.</p>
			<p class="card-text">After placing the sound files near your existing global files, which should be located in "YourClientFolder\Data\Sound", you will have to change a config file, which is located in "YourClientFolder\Config\GameOption.xml", somewhere in the last few rows it says "voiceIndex="2", 2 stands for English, change it to 0, which stands for Korean. For Chinese you have to change it to 3. For Japanese you have to change it to 1.</p>
			<p class="card-text">If you get some error with "keyname.xml", go to "YourClientFolder\Config\GameOption.xml" and in the last few rows change "languageIndex" to "2", which means English.</p>
			<p class="card-text">I haven't tested them much but they seem to work on the sounds that are also present on the respective versions, including emotes, but something like the GMS2 CBT emote will NOT work because it does not exist in the Korean sound files.</p>
