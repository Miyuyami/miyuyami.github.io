				<h3>Chinese MapleStory 2 Patches</h3>
				<p>English: <a class="link_cn_en" target="_blank">Download Link</a> (Last Update: <span class="t_CnEn">...</span>)</p>
				<p>Korean: <a class="link_cn_ko" target="_blank">Download Link</a> (Last Update: <span class="t_CnKo">...</span>)</p>
				<br>
				<p>The English patch is based off the Global client (GMS2) and the Korean patch is from the Korean client (KMS2).</p>
				<p>Items and achievements/trophies names are left in chinese so that you can safely link them in chat without anyone finding you suspicious (hopefully).</p>
				<p>Make sure you backup your original Xml.m2h and Xml.m2d (or just Xml if you cannot see extensions)</p>
				<p>You'll also need to remove the patch and place the original files back to update your game.</p>

				<h3>Korean MapleStory 2 Patches</h3>
				<p>English: <a class="link_kr_en" target="_blank">Download Link</a> (Last Update: <span class="t_KrEn">...</span>)</p>
				<p>Chinese: <a class="link_kr_zh" target="_blank">Download Link</a> (Last Update: <span class="t_KrZh">...</span>)</p>
				<br>
				<p>Same as the Chinese patches but for Korea...</p>
				<br>
				<p>You can use a simple "Game Starter" that I made to help with starting the game without having to go through patching (you still need to patch when a new patch is out!!!)</p>
				<p>This helps so that the nexon launcher won't start and replace the patched files. <a href="https://github.com/Miyuyami/NexonGameStarter/releases">You can find it on my github by clicking here.</a></p>
				<p>It's very easy to setup, make a shortcut of the GameStarter.exe then right click the shortcut and select Properties. Then under "Target" add at the end " 106498" (without quotes and note the space before the number).</p>
				<p>So if the target is "C:\Games\GameStarter.exe" you must edit it to "C:\Games\GameStarter.exe 106498". All you have to do now is run it from the shortcut.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As for how to use... open it and select the "Launch" option to start the game and skipping the file checking, if an error shows up or you know that there's been an update then choose the "Patch" option (make sure you put the backup "Xml" files so that they won't get redownloaded). Now wait until a new patch is available here (check "Last Update") then replace the files, now in the "game stater" choose launch again.</p>
